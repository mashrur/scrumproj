setup product

-- only involves create / updating product

unit tests>
- you should not be able to create a valid product without a name
- you should not be able to create more than one products with same name

create backlog item

-- set the product ref. some name, description, priority. story description, how to validate

unit tests>
you should not be able to create a valid backlog item without product reference, name, and story


sprint setup
-- start, end times, members, product
unit test>
you should not be able to create sprint without start, end, product reference and number of members must be more than zero
 be able to add backlog item to sprint without priority
 after adding it to sprint, it should refer to right sprintreference
 

task breakdown
create task
--- name, description, points, 

task pickup 
--- update task with member

task update
add new task update (value type) - description, points achieved


user stories
user will be able to add members
user will register a product
user will add some backlogs to that product
user will initiate a sprint
user will add/remove some backlogs to that sprint
user will be able to update a backlog item directly to update the points achieved
user will break down each backlog into multiple tasks
user will pick/release a task
user will do some work and update task accordingly
--- if a task is updated as complete, partial points will be achieved for the related backlog
user will update the final status for each backlog item - after watching the demo
user will review the sprint by adding some realizations

user will be able to drop a sprint


logic/constraints:
when you register a product, at least it should have a (unique) name
you can't delete a product, if it has any backlog
you can't delete a backlog if it is part of a sprint
you can't delete a sprint if it already started [start date]

backlog item cannot be created without a product reference
you cannot add a backlog item to a sprint, unless it has a priority
you cannot add a backlog item to a sprint, if there are other backlog items for the same product with more priority not already taken for the sprint
if a backlog directly updated for points achieved, member must be assigned for it
must have a member assigned to a task when it is picked or updated with achieved points

altogether points of tasks within a backlog item should not exceed the total points for the backlog
when updating the points within backlog, it should not allow to update it so that total points become greater than total achieved points




exceptions
remove backlog item from sprint after sprint has already started
